Description: Tools to help with data preparation for varied environmental
    analyses. Combine, re-running queries if requested, disparate data sources
    into one (dataframe). Queries can be re-run if they are named appropriately
    and stored in the /code folder of the project. Align and stack rasters to
    a template raster.
