\usage{
flag_sens_records(recs_df, nsx_col = NULL, surv_col = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{recs_df}{Dataframe of taxa records with \code{nsx_col} and \code{surv_col}.}

\item{nsx_col}{Character. Name of column containing BDBSA \code{NSXCODE} to check
for
\href{https://data.environment.sa.gov.au/Content/Publications/DEW_SAEnvironmentallySensitiveDataREGISTER.xls}{sensitivity}.}

\item{surv_nr}{Character. Name of column containing BDBSA
\verb{Survey Number} to check for
\href{https://apps.environment.sa.gov.au/emap/envmaps-query.do?cmd=su.SurveySummaryMain}{sensitivity}.}
}
\value{
\code{recs_df} with extra column(s) \code{sens_surv} and \code{sens_taxa} (logical).
}
\description{
This will flag records from both taxa and surveys identified as sensitive by
the Biological Databases of South Australia
(\href{https://www.environment.sa.gov.au/topics/Science/Information_data/Biological_databases_of_South_Australia}{BDBSA}).
Survey matches will only be done by \verb{Survey Number} (although it can be named
something else, as specified in \code{surv_nr}). Likewise, taxa matches will only
be done by \code{NSXCODE} (which can also be named something else, as specified in
\code{nsx_col}).
